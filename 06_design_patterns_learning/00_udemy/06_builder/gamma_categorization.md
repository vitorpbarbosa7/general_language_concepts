# Gamma Categhorization
Named after Erich Gamma, one of GoF authors

### Creational Patterns
* Deal with the creation (construction) of objects
* Explicit (constructor) vs. implicit (DI, reflection, etc ), last one example is creation of an object from another, and the creation is ocorring behind the curtains 
* Wholesale (single statement) vs.piecewise (step-by-step) - when creation actually does not occur instantly

### Structural Patterns
* Concerned with the structure (e.g., class members) - class hearing to some interface or other
* Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class' interface
* Stress the importance of good API design

### Behaviroal Patterns
* They don't really follow an central theme, are in general different
